# 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles | SURGE '23

Welcome to the main repository for my SURGE-2023 project, supervised by Dr. Pranamesh Chakraborty. This project aims to advance the field of autonomous driving by implementing and testing machine learning algorithms for 3D object detection, focusing on estimating vehicle kinematic parameters.

## Objective
- Develop and implement machine learning algorithms for effective 3D object detection.
- Collect and analyze LiDAR data to gain detailed environmental understanding and improve detection accuracy.

## Approach
- Trained and tested state-of-the-art algorithms such as VoxelNet and YOLO v5 using the KITTI and Pandas datasets.
- Collected extensive raw point cloud data from various locations with an instrumented vehicle, ensuring diverse environmental conditions.
- Employed C++ and Python for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing over 15,000 frames of collected data.

## Results
- Achieved notable detection accuracy: 77% for cars, 52% for pedestrians, and 62% for cyclists using the PointPillars algorithm.
- Compiled a comprehensive end-term report and poster presentation, summarizing research findings and highlighting the project's contributions to autonomous vehicle technology.
